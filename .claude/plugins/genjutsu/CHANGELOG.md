# Changelog

All notable changes to this plugin are documented here. Format inspired by [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## v3.0.3 - 2026-07-23

### Fixed

- `paint`: the brainstorm question shown when the user tries to skip brainstorming was still in French and got emitted verbatim to the user. It is now English, matching the rest of the skill (same class of leak as #3, one occurrence had been missed).

### Changed

- Translated the `gsap` reference docs (`_jutsu/gsap/references/core.md` and `timeline.md`) from French to English, so the sub-skill is fully English like the rest of the plugin. Translation only, no API or code changes (the remaining French flagged in #3).

## v3.0.2 - 2026-07-23

### Security

- `ui-ux-pro-max`: the `--persist` flow no longer lets `--project-name` or `--page` escape the output directory. Both values were turned into filesystem paths with only lowercase + space-to-dash, so a `../` or an absolute value could write outside `design-system/` (an arbitrary-write primitive when the script is agent-driven). They now pass through a shared `safe_path_component()` that collapses each value to a single safe path segment. Thanks to @reevesc88 (#4).

### Fixed

- `cast` and `paint` now resolve `_jutsu` sub-skills from the installed plugin version via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, instead of a `find | head -1` that could pick the marketplace clone (a stale version after `/plugin marketplace update`). A guarded, cache-restricted fallback covers the case where the placeholder is not substituted. Thanks to @malle-van-moa (#3).
- Removed a stale v2.0 rollout note in `cast` and `paint` that told the agent to skip the Compose/SwiftUI sub-skills; those shipped in v3.0.1 and the note contradicted the LOAD table above it. (#3)

### Changed

- Translated the remaining French user-facing strings in `cast` and `paint` (the legacy-bridge question and one DISCOVER example) to English. (#3)

## v3.0.1 - 2026-07-18

### Fixed

- Sub-skill resolution in `cast` and `paint` now works when genjutsu is installed via the marketplace. The `PLUGIN_ROOT` lookup is version-tolerant and matches the versioned cache layout (`~/.claude/plugins/cache/genjutsu/genjutsu/<version>/skills/`) in addition to git-clone installs. Previously the versioned path never matched, so all 15 `_jutsu` sub-skills failed to load on marketplace installs. Thanks to @SatishRockzz (#2).

## v3.0.0 - 2026-04-26

**BREAKING CHANGE - Rebrand**: `creative-excellence` is now `genjutsu`. The two orchestrators have new names that match the new theme.

### Renamed

- Plugin: `creative-excellence` -> `genjutsu`
- Orchestrator (creative coding): `creative-excellence` -> `cast` (The Illusionist)
- Orchestrator (design pipeline): `design-excellence` -> `paint` (The Master Painter)
- Internal sub-skills directory: `_creative/` -> `_jutsu/`
- GitHub repository: `AThevon/creative-excellence` -> `AThevon/genjutsu`

### Migration guide

**For users on Claude Code:**

```bash
# 1. Uninstall the old plugin
/plugin uninstall creative-excellence

# 2. Remove the old marketplace
/plugin marketplace remove creative-excellence

# 3. Add the new marketplace
/plugin marketplace add git@github.com:AThevon/genjutsu.git

# 4. Install
/plugin install genjutsu
```

Old invocations -> new invocations:

| Old | New |
|---|---|
| `/creative-excellence:creative-excellence` | `/genjutsu:cast` |
| `/creative-excellence:design-excellence` | `/genjutsu:paint` |

**For users on claude.ai:**

1. Remove the old `creative-excellence` and `design-excellence` skills from your skills list.
2. Re-download the latest release ZIPs (now named `cast.zip`, `paint.zip`, plus the renamed `genjutsu-all.zip`).
3. Re-upload everything.

**For users with the dotfiles submodule pattern:**

```bash
cd ~/.dotfiles

# Deinit the old submodule
git submodule deinit -f claude/plugins/creative-excellence
git rm -rf claude/plugins/creative-excellence
rm -rf .git/modules/claude/plugins/creative-excellence

# Re-add with the new URL
git submodule add git@github.com:AThevon/genjutsu.git claude/plugins/genjutsu

# Update install.sh and settings.json (replace creative-excellence with genjutsu)
# Then run install
./install.sh
```

### Added

- Voice rules in both `cast/SKILL.md` and `paint/SKILL.md`: light ninja flair during execution, plain factual reports at the end (no mystic prose in summaries).

### Notes

- Zero functional change. All sub-skills (`motion-principles`, `gsap`, `compose-motion`, `swiftui-graphics`, etc.) work identically. Only naming and voice changed.
- The old GitHub URL `github.com/AThevon/creative-excellence` automatically redirects to the new one.

## v2.0.0 - 2026-04-25

Major release: cross-platform expansion. The plugin now covers Web, Android (Jetpack Compose / Compose Multiplatform), and Apple (SwiftUI iOS + macOS) in addition to the existing web stacks.

### Added

- New shared layer `mobile-principles` (touch targets, no-hover doctrine, thumb zones, safe areas, gestures, mobile perf budgets) with 2 deep-dive references (`gestures-deep.md`, `accessibility-mobile.md`).
- New shared layer `desktop-principles` (hover-mandatory, pointer precision, keyboard shortcuts, multi-window, focus management) with 2 deep-dive references (`keyboard-patterns.md`, `multi-window.md`).
- New stack `compose-motion` (Jetpack Compose animation foundations: `animate*AsState`, `AnimatedVisibility`, `SharedTransitionLayout`, springs, gestures) with 3 deep-dives (`shared-transitions.md`, `gestures-compose.md`, `recomposition-and-anim.md`).
- New stack `compose-graphics` (advanced Compose visuals: M3 Expressive motion physics, AGSL shaders Android 13+, Canvas/DrawScope generative) with 3 deep-dives (`agsl-recipes.md`, `m3-expressive-deep.md`, `canvas-generative.md`).
- New stack `compose-multiplatform` (KMP/CMP patterns, expect/actual, iOS/Android/Desktop interop) with 2 deep-dives (`cmp-interop.md`, `cmp-platform-quirks.md`).
- New stack `swiftui-motion` (`withAnimation`, transitions, `matchedGeometryEffect`, `PhaseAnimator`, `KeyframeAnimator`, gestures) with 3 deep-dives (`springs-cheatsheet.md`, `phase-keyframe-deep.md`, `gestures-swiftui.md`).
- New stack `swiftui-graphics` (Metal shaders, `.visualEffect`, Liquid Glass iOS 26, Canvas) with 3 deep-dives (`metal-recipes.md`, `liquid-glass-deep.md`, `canvas-swiftui.md`).
- Stack-aware MASTER.md generation in `design-excellence` (now `genjutsu:paint`): produces Tailwind/CSS for web, Kotlin Theme.kt for Compose, Swift extensions for SwiftUI, KMP commonMain for CMP.
- Cross-platform AUDIT checklist in both orchestrators (Layout Inspector, Macrobenchmark, Instruments Time Profiler, Hitches Instrument, GPU Frame Capture).
- Conditional DISCOVER question for legacy bridge integration (XIB / storyboard / layout XML / setContentView detection).

### Changed

- Phase SCAN extended in both orchestrators to detect Android Compose (`androidx.compose`), Compose Multiplatform (`org.jetbrains.compose` + `kotlin-multiplatform`), SwiftUI (Package.swift / xcodeproj / @main App), and to distinguish iOS vs macOS targets.
- Phase LOAD restructured into layered tables (foundation always / context layers by detection / stack-specific by SCAN). Advanced sub-skills (`compose-graphics`, `swiftui-graphics`) only loaded for advanced thesis containing terms like "shader", "Metal", "AGSL", "Liquid Glass", "M3 Expressive".
- IRON RULES 7-8 generalized to be stack-agnostic (previously React/GSAP-specific).
- THESIS examples extended with cross-platform examples (SwiftUI matchedGeometryEffect, Compose SharedTransitionLayout, macOS hover, AGSL shader).
- `motion-principles` reduced-motion section now covers 5 platforms (Web CSS, Web JS, SwiftUI, UIKit, Compose) with code examples.
- `motion-principles` Universal Do Not Rules now include native (SwiftUI + Compose) BAD/GOOD examples in addition to CSS/JS/GSAP.
- `design-audit` now greps multi-stack (web + Compose + SwiftUI), reports bundle sizes for native libs (Lottie/Rive), and includes a stack-specific audit subsection (Layout Inspector / Macrobenchmark / Instruments Time Profiler / Hitches / GPU Frame Capture).

### Notes

- Zero web regression: existing web sub-skills (`gsap`, `framer-motion`, `css-native`, `threejs-r3f`, `canvas-generative`) and `ui-ux-pro-max` are unchanged.
- The plugin grows from 8 sub-skills to 15. The `package-for-claude-ai.sh` script automatically picks up new sub-skills (no script change needed).
